# MachineLearning
This is the repository used to learn Machine-Learning. It contains many of the classic algorithms implemented by **numpy**.

This repository is just for **learning purposes**. and there may be a lot of bugs or stupidities here. But these codes can help me better understand machine learning.

### /Library/Algorithms
In this file, there are some well-written algorithms, including **Linear-Regression, Logistic-Regression, Backpropagation, K-means, SVM.**

### /Demos
In the Demos folder, there are some usages of other functions or classes here, and you can check out these demos if necessary.
